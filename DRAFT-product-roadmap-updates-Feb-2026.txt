# UPDATED DELIVERY ROADMAP (Aligned + Protected)
## Guiding Principles (State These Explicitly)

Banking-first UX

Brand-agnostic core architecture

Minimal ecosystem surface at launch

Monetisation-enabling infrastructure built from day one

Operational simplicity for XX Group

This framing shows alignment.

## Phase 0 – Scope Alignment & Commercial Lock (Jan 2026)

### Objectives

Lock MVP scope (banking-first)

Confirm rewards funding model

Confirm minimum content commitment (lightweight)

Define success metrics (Active Users, Activation Rate, Monthly Transacting Users)

### Deliverables

Updated Figma (banking-first)

Rewards funding agreement (tiered incentives confirmed)

Defined “Ecosystem Module” scope (see below)

Scheme marketing target alignment

## Phase 1 – Core Build (Q1 2026)
### Core Banking (Primary)

Onboarding + UK KYC

Wallet & account creation

Virtual card issuance

Card controls (freeze, details, limits)

Transaction history (clean, scalable feed)

Top-ups

Direct debit + standing order setup (if technically feasible)

Push notifications

AI-assisted Tier 1 support

### Infrastructure (Silent but Strategic)

Event-driven analytics architecture

Impression tracking framework

Offer redemption tracking

Tier/segment tagging framework

Consent & GDPR tagging layer

Rewards ledger system (even if basic initially)

This is your future-proofing.

## Phase 1B – Ecosystem MVP (Minimal, Controlled)
### Module A – Ecosystem Highlights Module

On Wallet home:

- Small dynamic carousel (1–3 slots)

- Types:

	- Reward unlock announcements

	- Event-related incentives

	- Limited-time partner offer

	- VIP tier recognition

No infinite scroll.
No heavy media feed.
No CMS complexity.

Tracking:

- Impression events

- Click-through events

- Conversion events

Operationally light.
Strategically powerful.

### Module B – Behaviour-Triggered Rewards

Financial behaviour → Ecosystem reinforcement.

Examples:

- Spend £X → unlock entry to draw

- Match day → cashback boost

- Tier upgrade → exclusive perk

- Referral → VIP status bump

This does two things:

1. Drives transaction velocity (their scheme $ incentive)

2. Requires financial commitment from XX (reward funding)

This is the subtle leverage point.

## Phase 2 – Family & Friends Pilot (Apr–May 2026)

Focus:

Banking stability

Reward mechanics testing

Impression tracking validation

Support model load testing

Strict rule:
No new feature additions during pilot.

## Phase 3 – Public Launch (June 2026)

Live:

Wallet-first UX

Virtual card

Core payments

Ecosystem Highlights Module (lightweight)

Tiered rewards engine (basic)

Referral tracking

Scheme marketing tracking metrics

NOT live:

Full content feed

Creator commerce

Social/community

Crypto

Deep personalisation

Marketplace

## Phase 4 – Monetisation Expansion (Q3–Q4 2026)

Only after:

25k–50k active users

Clear engagement data

Add:

Sponsor-funded campaigns

Segmented offers

Enhanced analytics dashboard for XX

Limited personalisation rules

P2P payments (if strategically justified)

Push back here:

Community/social features

Marketplace

Creator commerce

These should not distract from monetisation proof.

## Phase 5 – Strategic Expansion (2027)

Advanced rewards

Deeper ecosystem integration (if proven valuable)

Crypto via third party

Token-gated experiences

Marketplace

Only if unit economics proven.

## ITEMS YOU SHOULD PUSH BACK ON (Politely)

From their navigation proposal:

1. P2P Payments

High compliance + fraud complexity.
Not required for launch.
Move to Phase 4.

2. Request Money / Transfers Between Users

Same risk as above.
Not core to scheme-driven growth.

3. Complex Scheduled Payment Management

Build basic version only.
Avoid recreating a challenger bank.

4. Community/Social Early

High moderation risk.
No clear ROI until scale.

Our position:

Let’s stabilise financial product and monetisation first.

This is responsible leadership.

## (Background) Why Option A + B Is Strategic

It allows us to say:

“We are not building a media app.”

But also:

“We are building measurable engagement surfaces.”

And critically:

It requires XX to financially commit to rewards funding.

That ensures:

Real incentives

Real behavioural reinforcement

Real scheme marketing upside
