# TRIBE 
## 1. Company Overview

TRIBE is a fintech platform combining:

* Debit card (via UK sponsor bank – Equals)
* Wallet-based mobile app (retail first, UK launch)
* Fan engagement features for entertainment / esports brands
* Future roadmap including crypto, stablecoins, Web3, and AI-powered engagement

The company operates with:

* Jersey parent entity
* UK launch focus initially
* Sponsor bank providing regulated card infrastructure via API
* TRIBE providing the front-end app and fan engagement layer

Target customers:

* Fan communities (e.g. esports, entertainment, creators)
* Brands seeking monetisation and engagement tools
* Sponsors looking to leverage transaction data and engagement analytics
* Launch partner signed for 2026 - V Media Group

Launch strategy - 2026:

* V media has links to and owns strong sports personalities.  
* they have promised to market TRIBE's card/banking product to their fan base with 10k customers per month growth (all going well).  
* we think this is ambitious, but is serious income for us if we can charge a small monthly fee - e.g. 5GBP - per customer (and V Media agrees to incentivise new fans to sign up with rewards/perks).  
* the more they manage to sign up, the more marketing budget they can get from the card scheme provider, so it's a win-win in terms of signing on new paying card subscribers
* if this launch is successful it should lead to other similar sports/gaming/media companies
