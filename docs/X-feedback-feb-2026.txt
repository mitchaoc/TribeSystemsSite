# Initial Feedback
Given the diverse nature of the XX Group’s ecosystem, and with the recent acquisition and
integration of YY well known sport person's brand, XX have determined that a brand agnostic approach to
the bank offering is the most appropriate for the most impactful integration across the ecosystem.
In their current guise, the Figma designs and wireframes that Tribe have proposed are heavily reliant on the vast amounts of
content, social media and activities of XX and the branding is heavily dependent on that of the XX
Group website. It is XX's direction that in order to ensure service viability, the application
needs to be designed for banking first and XX's ecosystem activity second.
Following this direction, the application details that are most apt would be those contained within the
existing Wallet and Profile categories, which encompass banking, rewards, shopping and customisation
functions. XX proposes the following updated application navigation:
