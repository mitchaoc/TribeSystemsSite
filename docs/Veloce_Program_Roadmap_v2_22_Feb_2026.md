# TRIBE and Veloce

## Consumer Banking App --- Launch Roadmap (v2 Lean)

**Date:** February 2026\
**Status:** For Alignment & Build Start

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Executive Alignment

Following recent discussions and Figma feedback, this roadmap reflects a
shared direction:

-   A **banking-first, wallet-led product**
-   A **brand-agnostic core platform**
-   A **lightweight but measurable ecosystem layer**
-   A focused path to **UK public launch in June 2026**

This version simplifies the original content-heavy concept and
prioritises:

-   Launch stability\
-   Card activation and transaction velocity\
-   Scheme marketing alignment\
-   Operational simplicity

Once aligned, this roadmap forms the basis for build commencement and
SOW finalisation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Guiding Principles

1.  **Banking-First UX**\
    The wallet is the home screen. Users always land on their balance,
    card and transactions.

2.  **Brand-Agnostic Core Platform**\
    A single codebase supports Veloce, Quadrant and future partners via
    themed builds.

3.  **Engagement-Smart (Not Content-Heavy)**\
    Engagement surfaces are lightweight, measurable and tied to
    financial behaviour.

4.  **Operational Simplicity at Launch**\
    Features requiring complex compliance, moderation or infrastructure
    are sequenced post-launch.
