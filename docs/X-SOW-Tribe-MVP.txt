# Statement of Work: Tribe x V Media Consumer Banking App — MVP

**Version:** 1.0 (Draft)
**Date:** February 2026
**Parties:** Tribe Systems Ltd ("Tribe"), V Media Media Group ("V Media")

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Tribe Systems will design, develop and deliver a consumer-facing mobile application for iOS and Android that combines everyday banking functionality with fan engagement features for the V Media Group ecosystem, including the Q Media brand.

The application provides users with a branded digital wallet and Visa debit card, enabling them to manage their finances while earning rewards and accessing exclusive content, experiences and merchandise tied to V Media and Q Media.

**Launch target:** Public release at Money 2026 (June 2026), preceded by an invite-only Family & Friends pilot (April–May 2026).

**Market:** United Kingdom only for MVP. EU expansion planned post-launch.

**Banking infrastructure:** Provided by Railsr/Equals (merged entity). Equals APIs supply account management, card issuance, KYC and transaction processing. A separate workstream covers banking API integration and is not part of this SOW.

**Architecture principle:** The application core is brand-agnostic. V Media and Q Media are the launch partners, but the platform is designed to onboard additional fan communities with distinct branding, content and reward structures without rebuilding the application.

---

**MVP scope flag:**
- **IN** = included in June 2026 launch
- **OUT** = deferred to post-launch phases (placeholder UI only at launch)

## 10. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Equals API delays or instability | Blocks core banking functionality | Medium | Early API integration, mock APIs for parallel development |
| KYC rejection rates higher than expected | Reduces pilot user base | Low | Pre-screen pilot users, provide clear ID requirements |
| App Store rejection | Delays launch | Low | Follow platform guidelines strictly, submit early for review |
| Scope creep from partner requests | Delays delivery | Medium | This SOW as contractual scope baseline, change request process |
| Content not ready from V Media | Rewards/Shop tabs launch empty | Medium | Design tabs to work with minimal content, placeholder states |
| Plus tier limits not confirmed | Incomplete product offering | Low | Launch with Everyday and Premium if Plus not finalised |

## 11. Change Management

Any changes to the scope defined in this SOW must be submitted as a formal Change Request (CR). Each CR will be assessed for impact on timeline, cost and resources before approval. Changes to MVP scope after SOW sign-off may affect the Money 2026 launch date.

## Appendix A: Clickable Prototype

A mid-fidelity clickable prototype is available at the project's Netlify deployment URL under `/prototype`. This prototype demonstrates:

- The complete navigation structure (Wallet, Payments, Rewards, Shop tabs + side menu)
- Detailed wallet screens matching the Figma designs
- Brand theming toggle (V Media / Q Media) demonstrating the brand-agnostic architecture
- Onboarding flow structure

The prototype uses mock data and does not connect to banking APIs. It serves as a visual validation tool for this SOW and should be reviewed alongside this document.
